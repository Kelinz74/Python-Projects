### [Nice Or Mean Text Game](https://github.com/Kelinz74/Python-Projects/blob/main/NiceOrMeanGame.py)
- Made a text based game with choices and results from each choice made.  Resulting in two different endings from choices made
- In the game you will be able to choose to be nice, or mean, when a stranger approaches you for a conversation.
- There is a possibility for two different endings, either nice or bad.
